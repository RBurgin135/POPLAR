# POPLAR mnist-digit recognition

This was one of the projects I made over the first Covid lockdown, when I was 16. I made it using Pygame. It is exclusively coded in python. It uses the MNIST dataset I have accessed through the Tensorflow library.

This project holds a deeplearning AI that aims to recognise digits in a 28x28 grid. I created everything from scratch including the deep learning arithmetic. The spacebar can be used to pause calculations.
